## Project Overview
This project explores three years of sales data from an international FMCG company operating across both Anglophone and Francophone territories in West Africa. Using structured SQL queries, I addressed 21 real-world business questions focused on profit analysis, brand performance, and regional consumption insights. The goal: uncover patterns, surface high-performing segments, and help business leaders make strategic decisions that drive profit and reduce losses.

## Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL-compatible queries)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Objectives
- Analyze total profit trends across regions and time periods.
- Identify top-performing countries, brands, and products.
- Examine regional consumption patterns, with a focus on Budweiser and beer sales.
- Generate actionable business insights through SQL and visualizations.
